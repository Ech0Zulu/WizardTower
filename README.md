Lore: 

You are Kael, a young adventurer known for your unyielding curiosity and unshakable loyalty. Your closest friend, Eryon, a reclusive but kind-hearted magician, vanished without a trace after sharing cryptic whispers of a groundbreaking discovery. One day, you receive a mysterious letter—a torn page from one of his spellbooks—marked with these chilling words:
"Seek the Ten. Fulfill the Ritual. Only then will the truth reveal itself."

Determined to uncover what happened, you set off on a journey to recover 10 ancient crystals scattered across a dangerous and puzzling landscape. Each crystal pulses with strange energy, locked away behind trials of wit, courage, and agility. As you collect them, the world around you seems to shift—shadows grow longer, whispers echo through the air, and reality begins to feel... unstable.

The final step of the ritual is unknown. Will it guide you to Eryon, or will it reveal something far darker—a secret he tried to hide?

Every crystal you gather brings you closer to the answer, but also closer to the unknown. Will you risk it all to find the truth?
