2) Using cubes to create some simple game mechanics in Unity of collecting game objects (Make a few screenshots) - (E.g Infinite Runner, or rupee collection in zelda)   O
3) Later add a Cinemachine to follow your player. The camera should go from your created wizard tower to the main character seamlessly (Screenshot)                      O
